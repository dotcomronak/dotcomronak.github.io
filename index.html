  <h1>Hey, I'm Ronak.</h1>
  <p>I go by <strong>dotcomronak</strong> on the internet. I'm a developer and a builder who writes Python, tries out random ideas, and occasionally stumbles upon ones that actually work.</p>

  <p>I'm not a big fan of the whole **status game** everyone seems to be playing these days. I'm more into doing real things that create **actual, tangible change**—especially when that change is driven by consistent, slow effort.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Building Community & Impact</h2>
  <p>My current focus is on combining my passion for code with community building. I am actively involved in two key initiatives:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>CodeDay Organizer (1 yr 3 mos in Pune)</h3>
      <p>I am the lead **Organizer** for **CodeDay** in Pune, managing every aspect of bringing this global high school hackathon to the city. My goal is to host the **best high school hackathon** in the region, providing a platform for young, bright minds to learn, build, and connect without the pressure of the 'status game.' This is all about real, hands-on creation.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Project Bloom</h3>
      <p>I co-run **Project Bloom**, where my friends and I hike up mountains—not just for the view—but to pick up trash left behind. This is where slow, consistent action truly matters. We’ve collectively carried back around **30 kgs of waste** so far, creating small but visible change. You can follow our journey on <a href="https://instagram.com/projectbloom.pune" target="_blank">@projectbloom.pune</a>.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>Let's Talk</h2>
  <p>You can talk to me about **finance, stocks, economic policy**, or honestly anything that involves thinking deeply about how the world works and how we can make it better.</p>

  <p>I also write blogs on <a href="https://medium.com/@dotcomronak" target="_blank">Medium</a>, covering topics related to money, code, and mindset.</p>

  <p>If you want to reach out, you can message me anywhere at **@dotcomronak**, or connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dotcomronak/" target="_blank"><strong>LinkedIn</strong></a>. For direct communication, you can email me:</p>
