  <h1>Hey, I'm Ronak.</h1>

  <p>I go by <strong>dotcomronak</strong> on the internet. I'm a developer and a builder who writes Python, tries out random ideas, and occasionally stumbles upon ones that actually work.</p>

  <p>I'm not a big fan of the whole <em>status game</em> everyone seems to be playing these days. I'm more into doing real things that make <em>actual</em> change, even if it's slow. Especially if it's slow.</p>

  <h2>Building Community & Impact</h2>
  <p>My current focus is on combining my passion for code with community building. I am actively involved in two key initiatives:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>CodeDay Organizer</h3>
      <p>I am the lead <strong>Organizer</strong> for <strong>CodeDay</strong> in Pune, managing every aspect of bringing this global high school hackathon to the city. My goal is to host the <strong>best high school hackathon</strong> in the region, providing a space for young, bright minds to learn, build, and connect without the pressure of the 'status game.' This is all about real, hands-on creation.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Project Bloom</h3>
      <p>I run <strong>Project Bloom</strong>, where my friends and I hike up mountains; not just for the view—but to pick up trash left behind. This is where slow, consistent action truly matters. We’ve collectively carried back around <strong>50+ kgs of waste</strong> so far, creating small but visible change. You can follow our journey on <a href="https://instagram.com/projectbloom.pune" target="_blank">@projectbloom.pune</a>.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Let's Talk</h2>

  <p>You can talk to me about finance, stocks, policy, or honestly anything that involves thinking about how the world works and how to make it better.</p>

  <p>I also write blogs on <a href="https://medium.com/@dotcomronak" target="_blank">Medium</a>, covering topics related to money, code, and mindset.</p>

  <p>If you want to reach out, you can message me anywhere at <strong>@dotcomronak</strong>, or connect with me on 
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dotcomronak/" target="_blank"><strong>LinkedIn</strong></a>.
    For direct communication, you can email me:
