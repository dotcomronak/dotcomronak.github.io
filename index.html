  <h1>Hey, I'm Ronak.</h1>
  <p>I go by <strong>dotcomronak</strong> on the internet. I write Python, try out random ideas, and occasionally stumble upon ones that actually work.</p>

  <p>I'm not a big fan of the whole <em>status game</em> everyone seems to be playing these days. I'm more into doing real things that make <em>actual</em> change, even if it's slow. Especially if it's slow.</p>

  <p>Right now, I'm working on bringing <strong>CodeDay</strong> to Pune and running <strong>Project Bloom</strong>, where my friends and I hike up mountains, not for the view, but to pick up trash people leave behind. We've carried back around 30 kgs of it so far (<a href="https://instagram.com/projectbloom.pune" target="_blank">@projectbloom.pune</a>).</p>

  <p>You can talk to me about <strong>finance, stocks, policy</strong>, or honestly anything that involves thinking about how the world works and how to make it better.</p>

  <p>I do write blogs on <a href="https://medium.com/@dotcomronak" target="_blank">Medium</a> about money, code and mindset.</p>

  <p>If you want to reach out, you can message me anywhere at <strong>@dotcomronak</strong>, or connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dotcomronak/" target="_blank"><strong>LinkedIn</strong></a>.</p>

  <p>Thank you :) </p>
